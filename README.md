# Project 2 Proposal
---
To predict parking space availability in the city of Seattle with weather temperature and precipitation.

---
My MVP will use linear regression to inspect the relationship between parking availability data obtained by tapping into the API of [Seattle Open Data portal](https://data.seattle.gov), and historical temperature scarped from [almanac.com](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sdg/2018.htm) .
